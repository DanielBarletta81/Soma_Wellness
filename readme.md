# 🌲 Soma Wellness Sanctuary

### *The Digital Mentor: Where Ancient Lineage Meets Modern Biological Science*

**Soma** is a high-fidelity, adaptive wellness platform designed for **C.J. Barletta**.

* **Biophilic Design:** Integrating pine and lotus motifs to trigger the "Biophilia Effect," lowering heart rate and stress through visual cues.
* **Chromotherapy:** Dynamic UI color shifting based on Ayurvedic Dosha states and Chakra frequencies.
* **Non-Linear Growth:** Replacing high-stress gamification with a logarithmic "Eternal Bloom" progression system.

---

* **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
* **Video Infrastructure:** AWS S3 + CloudFront + HLS (Adaptive Bitrate Streaming)

* **Chakra Sanctum:** A color-coded module mapping energy centers to endocrine glands and nerve plexuses.

### 3. The "Sacred Window" Motherhood Portal

A specialized environment for Prenatal and Postpartum care.

* **Hormonal Compass:** Visualizations and tools to navigate the 90% drop in Estrogen/Progesterone postpartum.
